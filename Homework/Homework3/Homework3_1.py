# Write a function that takes in a list of objects and converts each object in the list into a int.
# For objects that can't be directly converted to int should have their length counted
# The function will return a list with a int values ordered from largest to smallest.
# example [1, True, '123', False, 6, ()] will be transformed into [123, 6, 1, 1, 0, 0]
